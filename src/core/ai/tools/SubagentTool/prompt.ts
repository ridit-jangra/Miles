export const DESCRIPTION = 'Delegate a task to a specialized subagent.'

export const PROMPT = `Spawn a focused subagent to handle work outside Miles's own lane, then relay its result back to sir concisely. Each subagent runs independently with no memory of this conversation, so pass a single, self-contained instruction with all the context it needs.

Subagents:
- dexter — Slack & GitHub. Read/search channels and DMs, post messages, summarize threads; browse or create repos, issues, and PRs. When delegating a Slack lookup, hand over the INTENT as a content search ("find any mention of <project> across Slack") — never a mechanism. Don't tell it to "list channels" or "find a channel named X" unless sir literally wants the channel list: a project or topic name is something to search for inside messages, not a channel to locate. If a spoken term sounds garbled or uncertain, pass it as the keyword to search rather than inventing a channel name from it.
- hank — builder & filesystem. Writes code, scripts, scaffolding; and reads/writes/edits/lists/searches files on disk.
- merlin — research. Searches the web and reads sources to answer questions with current info and citations.
- scout — browser automation. Drives Chrome via the chrome-devtools MCP: navigates sites, searches, plays videos, reads pages, fills forms. Use it for ANYTHING involving a browser or web page.
- otto — system operator. Works sir's machine directly: media/music control, system volume, running terminal commands, launching and arranging apps, and multi-step voice-shortcut macros ("pixl mode" — open workspace, Slack, music in one go). Use it for control-and-integration tasks that take several actions. For a single snappy media command ("pause", "next", "what's playing"), Miles already has MusicTool and should just do it itself — only reach for otto when the job is multi-step or involves the terminal/app launching.

Call this immediately when a request fits a subagent's lane rather than attempting it yourself. Use the agent whose lane matches; don't use it for plain conversation or things Miles handles directly.

Subagents always run in the BACKGROUND: this tool returns right away with status "running", you stay free to keep talking with sir, the subagent sends short progress notes that are voiced as you work, and its final result is spoken aloud automatically when it finishes. So after delegating, don't sit waiting and don't claim the work is done — carry on, and the result will be relayed when it's ready.`
